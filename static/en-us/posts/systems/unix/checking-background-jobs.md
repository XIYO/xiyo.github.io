# CHECKING BACKGROUND JOBS

This document explains the `jobs` command, which is part of `Job control` in `UNIX` and `UNIX LIKE` systems.

The `jobs` command is used to check the jobs that are currently running in the `background` of the current `shell`.

In comparison to `Windows`,\
`jobs` is similar to checking the programs that are running in the `background`, minimized and not visible in the `foreground`, akin to the `taskbar`.

> 🔵 NOTE
>
> In UNIX, a `Job` refers to a collection of `Processes`. The PID of a job refers to the `Process Group ID`.

> 🔵 NOTE
>
> This was tested using `zsh` on MacOS, Sonoma.\
> `zsh` has extended features, and more information can be found in `man zshbuiltins`.

> 🔵 NOTE
>
> This document is a translation of the `jobs` description from `The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7`, provided by the official UNIX group, [`THE Open GROUP`](https://www.opengroup.org), and briefly explains the parts that users need to know.

## SYNOPSIS

- `[ ]` (brackets) are optional.
- `|` (pipe) indicates that one of several options can be chosen.
- `...` (three dots) indicates that multiple arguments can be specified.

```text
jobs [-l| -p][job_id...]
```

## OPTIONS

- `-l`\
  (lowercase **L**) provides more information about each listed job. This information includes the job number, current job, process group ID, state, and the command that formed the job.

- `-p`\
  displays only the process ID of the process group leader for the selected job.

## OPERANDS

- `job_id`\
  specifies the job for which to display the status. If no `job_id` is specified, status information for all jobs will be displayed. The format of `job_id` is described in XBD [`Job Control Job ID`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2016edition/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_204).

## STDOUT

If the **`-p` option** is specified,\
the output consists of one line for each process ID.

```text
"%d\n", <process ID>
```

If the **`-l option`** is not specified,\
the output consists of a series of lines in the following format.

```text
"[%d] %c %s %s\n", <job-number>, <current>, <state>, <command>
```

Where the fields are as follows:

- `<job-number>`

  - A number that can be used to identify the process group for the `wait`, `fg`, `bg`, and `kill` utilities.
  - These utilities can identify a job by prefixing the job number with `%`.

- `<current>`

  - The character `+` identifies the job that will be used as the default for the `fg` or `bg` utilities.\
    This job can also be specified using `job_id %+` or `"%%"`.
  - The character `-` identifies the job that will become the default when the current default job terminates.\
    This job can also be specified using `job_id %-`.
  - For other jobs, this field is a `space`.
  - At most one job can be identified with `+`, and at most one job can be identified with `-`.
  - If any job is suspended, the current job must be a suspended job.
  - If at least two jobs are suspended, the previous job must also be a suspended job.

- `<state>`\
  One of the following strings (in `POSIX locale`):

  - `Running`\
    Indicates that the job has not been stopped by a signal and has not terminated.
  - `Done`\
    Indicates that the job has completed and returned an exit status of `0`.
  - `Done(code)`\
    Indicates that the job has completed normally and terminated with the specified non-zero exit status, `code`.
  - `Stopped`\
    Indicates that the job has been stopped by the `SIGTSTP` signal.
  - `Stopped (SIGTSTP)`\
    Indicates that the job has been stopped by the `SIGTSTP` signal.
  - `Stopped (SIGSTOP)`\
    Indicates that the job has been stopped by the `SIGSTOP` signal.
  - `Stopped (SIGTTIN)`\
    Indicates that the job has been stopped by the `SIGTTIN` signal.
  - `Stopped (SIGTTOU)`\
    Indicates that the job has been stopped by the `SIGTTOU` signal.

- `<command>`
  - The relevant command provided to the shell.

If the **`-l option`** is specified,\
a field containing the process group ID is inserted before the `<state>` field.\
Additionally, more processes within the process group may be output on separate lines, using only the process ID and `<command>` fields.

## EXAMPLE

First, enter a command in the `shell` to create a simple `job`.

```shell
sleep 100 &
```

This command runs `sleep`, which waits for 10 minutes and then terminates, in the `background` using `&` (ampersand).

> 🔵 NOTE
>
> `&` (ampersand) is the command to run a process in the background in the current session.

The result of running the `jobs` command with **no options** is as follows.

Command input

```shell
jobs
```

Output

```text
[1] + 12345 Running sleep $((60 * 10)) &
```

The result of running the `jobs` command using `zsh` is as follows.\
In `zsh`, when a `job` terminates, `Done` is displayed.

> 🟣 IMPORTANT
>
> `zsh 5.9 (x86_64-apple-darwin23.0)` has a bug where using `jobs -p` should output only the process numbers, but it behaves the same as the `-l` option.\
> In contrast, `bash` correctly outputs only the process numbers with `jobs -p`.
