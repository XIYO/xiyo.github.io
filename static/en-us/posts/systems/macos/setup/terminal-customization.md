## What is Oh My Zsh?

Oh My Zsh is a tool that makes your terminal prettier and more convenient.
It provides auto-completion when typing commands, displays with color coding, and lets you see Git information at a glance.

```

Now that Oh My Zsh is installed, let's install more attractive themes and useful plugins.

```bash
# Change theme
sed -i '' 's/ZSH_THEME=".*"/ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k\/powerlevel10k"/' ~/.zshrc

# Activate plugins 
sed -i '' 's/plugins=(.*)/plugins=(git docker docker-compose zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)/' ~/.zshrc

# Apply settings

```

## Changing iTerm2 Color Theme

Want to make your terminal even prettier? Try changing the color theme.

> [!INFO]
> **What is a color theme?**
> 
> A combination of colors that changes the overall background, text, and highlight colors of the terminal.
> iTerm2 has built-in themes, and you can download additional ones.

### Change to Built-in Themes

First, check the themes built into iTerm2:

1. **iTerm2 → Settings → Profiles → Colors**
2. Click **"Color Presets..."** dropdown in bottom right
3. Available default themes include:
   - **Dark Background** (default dark theme)
   - **Light Background** (light theme)
   - **Pastel (Dark Background)** (pastel colors)
   - **Solarized Dark** (popular dark theme)
   - **Solarized Light** (popular light theme)
   - **Tango Dark** / **Tango Light**
4. Click desired theme to apply immediately

### Install More Themes

If you don't like the default themes, you can download hundreds of additional themes.

#### Popular Theme Recommendations

- **Dracula**: Popular dark purple theme
- **Tokyo Night**: Modern dark theme  
- **Gruvbox Dark**: Retro theme with warm colors
- **Catppuccin**: Soft pastel tone theme
- **Nord**: Minimal theme with cool blue tones

#### Download and Install Additional Themes

1. Visit [iTerm2 Color Schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com) website
2. Check theme previews
3. **Right-click** theme name link → Select **"Save Link As..."** to download `.itermcolors` file
4. Return to iTerm2:
   - **Settings → Profiles → Colors**
   - Click **"Color Presets..."** → **"Import..."**
   - Select downloaded `.itermcolors` file
   - Select imported theme from **"Color Presets..."** to apply

> [!INFO]
> **Downloaded theme files can be deleted**
> 
> Once you import a theme into iTerm2, the settings are copied and saved,
> so you can delete the `.itermcolors` files in your Downloads folder.

> [!TIP]
> **Theme Selection Tips**
> 
> - Dark themes are easier on the eyes for long coding sessions

## Powerlevel10k Configuration Wizard

When you restart the terminal, the Powerlevel10k configuration wizard starts automatically.

### MesloLGS NF Font Installation Notice

Before the configuration wizard starts, a screen appears recommending MesloLGS NF font installation:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Powerlevel10k Font Installation Process**
> 
> 1. When **"Install Meslo Nerd Font?"** question appears → Enter **y**
> 2. Powerlevel10k automatically downloads and installs MesloLGS NF font
> 3. **iTerm2 settings are also automatically changed** (font changes to MesloLGS NF)
> 
> This font is optimized for Powerlevel10k, but Korean characters might not display well.

### Configuration Wizard Progress

> [!INFO]
> **What is the configuration wizard?**
> 
> Powerlevel10k creates a prompt style tailored to your preferences through various questions.
> You can choose icon support, color style, information display method, etc.

### Recommended Settings (For Beginners)

It's recommended to select the following for each question:

- **Diamond** → **y** (y if you see diamond icon)
- **Lock** → **y** (y if you see lock icon)  
- **Debian** → **y** (y if you see Debian logo)
- **Style** → **3 (Rainbow)** (most popular colorful style)
- **Character Set** → **1 (Unicode)** (use Unicode characters)
- **Prompt Style** → **3 (Pure)** (clean 2-line style)
- **Transient Prompt** → **n** (keep default)
- **Instant Prompt** → **1 (Verbose)** (fast start)

### Change Back to Korean Font

After Powerlevel10k configuration, iTerm2 font will be changed to MesloLGS NF.
To properly display Korean, you need to change back to D2Coding Nerd Font:

1. **iTerm2 → Settings** (or `Cmd + ,`)
2. Select **Profiles → Text** tab
3. Confirm current font is "MesloLGS NF" in **Font** section
4. Click **Change Font**
5. Select **"D2CodingLigature Nerd Font"**
6. Size **14pt** recommended

> [!INFO]
> **Why set font twice?**
> 
> - **MesloLGS NF**: Font recommended by Powerlevel10k, displays all icons perfectly but not optimized for Korean
> - **D2Coding Nerd Font**: Font for Korean developers that displays Korean, English, and icons well
> 
> It's best to use MesloLGS NF during Powerlevel10k setup and switch to D2Coding afterwards.

> [!TIP]
> If you made a mistake or want to change later, you can always reconfigure:
> 
> ```bash
> p10k configure
> ```

## Verify Installation

Let's check if everything is installed correctly.

Open Terminal and copy-paste the following command:

```bash
echo $ZSH_THEME  # Should output powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
echo $SHELL      # Should output /bin/zsh
```

### Verification Points for Successful Installation

1. **Terminal Prompt**: Shows Git branch name, folder icons, etc.
2. **Auto-completion**: Gray text suggestions appear when typing commands  
3. **Syntax Highlighting**: Correct commands in green, incorrect commands in red
4. **Icons**: Nerd Font icons display properly without breaking
