> Projects opened in tabs

On macOS, you can configure multiple projects or documents to **open in tabs instead of new windows**. This setting applies not only to development tools but also to most tab-supporting apps (like Finder, Preview, etc.), and is useful for keeping your workspace organized.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a macOS feature.

## Settings to Open in Tabs

![always_open_tabs](/static/resources/b8e84f65bef3200d9888d2bc90183f76ec8c4fe129e8c0396e169265fefaffb656f2641df0f2dae9c7f59cc9c062dee44d39093993ea06acf46699d903d126cf.png)

> All applications will open in tabs.

1. Open System Settings
   Navigate to **System Settings > Desktop & Dock**.
2. Change Tab Settings
   Set `Prefer tabs when opening documents:` to **Always**.

> [!tip]
> This option **forces documents to open in tabs instead of new windows** when opening multiple documents in macOS-supported apps.

By utilizing this setting, you can efficiently work with multiple projects or documents by **switching between tabs** in a single window,
which can **increase focus and productivity**, especially in small screen environments or when multitasking heavily.
