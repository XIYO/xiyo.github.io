# Installing Drivers on LG Gram

This guide addresses driver issues that arise during the process of resetting and reinstalling the OS on the LG Gram.

## Problem

Due to the need to reset the OS, I had to install a completely clean version of the OS instead of the initially configured one. I anticipated that after the reset, the drivers would be automatically installed through Windows Update, but...

### No Wireless Driver

I expected that the wireless LAN driver would be installed by default after the installation, but contrary to my expectations, I had to install it manually.

> I downloaded the wireless LAN driver and installed it.

### Still Unable to Install Drivers via Update

Even after running Windows Update through the network, the USB and sound drivers were still not installed. Using the [IntelÂ® Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html) did not resolve the issue, as one Intel USB driver remained uninstalled, and I found it difficult to locate the Realtek sound driver for direct download from the official site.

## Solution

Ultimately, I was about to give up on installing the remaining drivers when I decided to check the [LG Download Center](https://www.lge.com/us/support/product-manuals) once more, and I discovered that there was a dedicated update tool...

> I had overlooked the "LG Update Program" while searching for the model name, but it became visible upon a second look...

After downloading and installing it, all the driver issues I was experiencing were resolved. It took about an hour and a half to install all the supporting software.
