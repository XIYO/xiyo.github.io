# Using GitHub Action Cache

While using GitHub Actions, I experienced a gradual slowdown in build speed. To improve this, I implemented caching strategies to save time on dependency installation.

## Changes in Build Speed

![Initial build speed was under 40 seconds](/static/resources/usging-cache-on-github-action-20240815232353052.png)

The initial build speed was quite fast, under 40 seconds. However, over time, the build time increased significantly, especially after adding the Mermaid parser to the Markdown files.

![The slowed build speed seems to be approaching 1 minute and 30 seconds](/static/resources/usging-cache-on-github-action-20240815232537900.png)

This issue is not solely due to the Mermaid syntax. My blog uses Svelte for pre-rendering, which requires parsing all Markdown files during the initial build.

Moreover, since I wanted the Markdown files to display correctly on GitHub without using front matter, I did not include metadata such as creation or modification dates. To compensate for this, I used the `git log` command to add that data, which increased CPU load and made performance improvement challenging. (Separating this into workers could enhance performance, but it's still a bit beyond my current skill level...)

![Even just installing dependencies took 30 seconds](/static/resources/usging-cache-on-github-action-20240815233139668.png)

Ultimately, to optimize the build, I decided to focus on reducing package installation time.

## Modifying the GitHub Workflow

`Initial Workflow` snippet

```yml
jobs:
  build_site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: build
        env:
          BASE_PATH: '/${{ github.event.repository.name }}'
        run: |
          pnpm run build
      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # this should match the `pages` option in your adapter-static options
          path: 'build/'
```

The initial workflow did not utilize caching at all. Since it was my first time using GitHub Actions and Svelte, I was just satisfied with getting the automatic build to work correctly.

`Optimized Workflow` snippet

```diff
jobs:
  build_site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install pnpm
-       uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
+       uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
-         version: 8
+         run_install: false

+     - name: Install Node.js
+       uses: actions/setup-node@v4
+       with:
+         node-version: 22
+         cache: 'pnpm'  # Enable cache for Node modules (using built-in feature)

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install # Cached installation speeds up the process

+     - name: Get installed Playwright version
+       id: playwright-version
+       run: echo "PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=$(pnpm list @playwright/test --depth=0 | grep @playwright/test | awk '{print $2}')" >> $GITHUB_ENV

+     - name: Cache playwright binaries
+       uses: actions/cache@v4.0.2
+       id: playwright-cache
+       with:
+         path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
+         key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ env.PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION }}

+     - run: pnpx playwright install --with-deps chromium
+       if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'

      - name: build
        env:
          BASE_PATH: '/${{ github.event.repository.name }}'
        run: |
          pnpm run build
      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # this should match the `pages` option in your adapter-static options
          path: 'build/'
```

The key to this optimized code is the effective use of caching.

The Node.js module cache is activated by setting the `cache: pnpm` option provided by `actions/setup-node@v4`. While there is a way to manually store the cache, I determined that utilizing the built-in abstracted option is more efficient.

In particular, I cached `playwright`, which was a major cause of the slowdown, minimizing installation time. If the cache already exists, the installation step can be skipped, further optimizing build time.

> \[!note]
> The Playwright version extraction feature in the code above is specific to the pnpm package. If you are using a different package manager, please refer to the appropriate code...🥲

## Changes in Build Speed

![Optimized build speed is around 1 minute and 10 seconds...](/static/resources/usging-cache-on-github-action-20240816000140052.png)

![Internal speed does not exceed 50 seconds](/static/resources/usging-cache-on-github-action-20240816000251502.png)

While the build speed did not improve dramatically, I achieved a satisfactory result through appropriate optimization.

### Additional Optimization Strategies

Here are a few more optimization methods to consider:

- Parallel execution
- Using custom runners to utilize custom containers
- Integrating all processes into a single workflow
