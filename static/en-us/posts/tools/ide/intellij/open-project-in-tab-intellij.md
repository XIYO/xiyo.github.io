> Projects opened in tabs

On macOS, you can configure multiple projects or documents to **open in tabs instead of new windows**. This setting applies not only to development tools but also to most tab-supporting apps (like Finder, Preview, etc.), and is useful for keeping your workspace organized.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a macOS feature.

## Settings to Open in Tabs

> All applications will open in tabs.

1. Open System Settings
   Navigate to **System Settings > Desktop & Dock**.
2. Change Tab Settings
   Set `Prefer tabs when opening documents:` to **Always**.

> [!tip]
> This option **forces documents to open in tabs instead of new windows** when opening multiple documents in macOS-supported apps.

By utilizing this setting, you can efficiently work with multiple projects or documents by **switching between tabs** in a single window,
which can **increase focus and productivity**, especially in small screen environments or when multitasking heavily.
